Challenges: 

Chapter 1 - Starting out in R. 

a) What happens when you try to make a vector containing different types, using c( )? Make a vector with some numbers, and some words (eg. character strings like “test”, or “hello”). 



b) Why does the output show the numbers surrounded by quotes " " like character strings are? 


Chapter 1 - Vectors

a) If the first four words are selected using the slice phrase[1:4], how can we obtain the first four words in reverse order?



b)  What is phrase[-2]? What is phrase[-5]? Given those answers, explain what phrase[-1:-3] does.



c) Use indexing of phrase to create a new character vector that forms the phrase “I know I don’t”, i.e. c("I", "know", "I", "don't"). 



Chapter 1 - Functions

a)  Use sum to sum from 1 to 5 (ie 1+2+3+4+5).



b)  Use sum to sum from 1 to 10,000.



c) You are reading some R code and see that it uses a function called seq. What does seq do? 



Chapter 2 - working with data in a matrix 
Suppose you want to determine the maximum particle size for resin 5 across operators 2 and 3. To do this you would extract the relevant slice from the matrix and calculate the maximum value. Which of the following lines of R code gives the correct answer? 

(a) max(mat[5, ])

(b) max(mat[2:3, 5]) 
 
(c) max(mat[5, 2:3]) 
                                        
(d) max(mat[5, 2, 3]) 
                                
                        
                
Chapter 2 - summarizing the matrix
                                                                                      

a) How would you calculate the standard deviation for each resin? 
    
    
                                        
b) Advanced: How would you calculate the values two standard deviations above and below the mean for each resin? 
                                
                        
                
Chapter 2 - using t.test

a) Can you find a significant difference between any two resins? 
                                
                        
                
Chapter 2 - plotting data

a) create a plot showing the standard deviation for each resin.



Chapter 3 - Working with a data frame

a) Which female subjects from Buckingham are under the age of 25?



b) What is their average glyhb?



c) Are any of them diabetic?



d) Test your understanding by writing your solutions several different ways. 
                                
                        
                
Chapter 3 - summarizing data frames

a)  Find the age of the youngest and oldest subject, for each gender and in each location in the study. 
        
        
                                
b) Extension: How could we clean up the data frame so we never needed to use na.rm=TRUE when summarizing glyhb values? 
                                
                        
                
Chapter 4 - Plotting with ggplot2 

This R code will get the data from the year 2007: 
                                        
gap2007 <- gap[ gap$year == 2007 ,]

Create a ggplot of this with gdpPercap on the x-axis and lifeExp on the y-axis. 




Chapter 4 - Fine tuning a ggplot

Continuing with your scatter-plot of the 2007 data, add axis labels to your plot.


Advanced: Give your x axis a log scale (see the documentation on scale_x_continuous, specifically the trans argument).
                                
                        
                
Chapter 4 - faceting

Let’s return again to your scatter-plot of the 2007 data.

Adjust your plot to now show data from all years, with each year shown in a separate facet, using 
                                        
facet_wrap(~ year).

Advanced: Highlight Australia in your plot.
