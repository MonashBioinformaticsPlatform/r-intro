These are the course notes for the "Introduction to R" course given by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform.

R is both a programming language and an interactive environment for statistics. Today we will be concentrating on R as an *interactive environment*.

We will be using RStudio, a friendly front end to R. On the day, we will be using RStudio from the web, but you can also install R and RStudio on your laptop. Both R and RStudio are free.

* [Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
