# Next steps

We have barely touched the surface of what R has to offer. If you want to take your skills to the next level, here are some topics to investigate:

### Books

["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham is a good modern introduction to R, and can be read online. [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) also has several excellent books covering specific topics online.

"Linear Models with R" and "Extending the Linear Model with R" by Julian J. Faraway cover linear models, with many practical examples. Linear models, and the linear model formula syntax `~`, are core to much of what R has to offer statistically. Many statistical techniques take linear models as their starting point, including `limma` for differential gene expression, `glm` for logistic regression (etc), survival analysis with `coxph`, and mixed models to characterize variation within populations.

"Modern Applied Statistics with S" by W.N. Venable and B.D. Ripley is a well respected reference covering R and its predecessor S.

See "The R Book" by Michael J. Crawley for general reference.

### Cheat sheets

* [RStudio's collection of cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) cover newer packages in R.
* [An old-school cheat sheet](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf) for dinosaurs and people wishing to go deeper.
* [Bioconductor cheat sheet](https://github.com/mikelove/bioc-refcard/blob/master/README.Rmd)

### More packages

* [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/) has hundreds of contributed packages which can be installed with `install.packages`.
* [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) is another huge collection of packages with a biological focus.

### Life outside R

Not all data analysis is done in R. The Software Carpentry workshops give a broader introduction to computing in science.

### Q&A sites

Stackoverflow-style sites are great for getting help:

* [support.bioconductor.org](https://support.bioconductor.org) for bioconductor related questions.
* [biostars.org](https://biostars.org) for general bioinformatics questions.
* [stats.stackexchange.com](http://stats.stackexchange.com) for statistics questions.
* [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) for general programming questions.

### Community

The Monash Bioinformatics Platform offers:

* Weekly drop in sessions where you can get help with R, or general bioinformatics problems.
* Informal Wednesday afternoon talks, which often relate to R.
* Courses on various topics through the year.

Also, the [COMBINE](https://combine.org.au/) student and early career researcher organization runs Software Carpentry workshops.
